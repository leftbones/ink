# Ink Text Editor

Ink is a new text editor made with similar principles to Vim and Emacs, but with the modern user in mind. After using both of these editors for years, I found myself thinking, "What would Vim/Emacs be like if they were made from scratch today?", and so I decided to explore those ideas with Ink.
Ink is written in C to be fast and light, and only relies on ncurses for it's interface. Eventually, I plan to look into a graphical renderer similar to Emacs.
